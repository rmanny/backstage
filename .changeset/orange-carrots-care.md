'@backstage/plugin-cost-insights': patch
---

Migrated to new composability API, exporting the plugin instance as `costInsightsPlugin`, the root `'/cost-insights'` page as `CostInsightsPage`, the `'/cost-insights/investigating-growth'` page as `CostInsightsProjectGrowthInstructionsPage`, and the `'/cost-insights/labeling-jobs'` page as `CostInsightsLabelDataflowInstructionsPage`.
